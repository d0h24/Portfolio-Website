            I am an aspiring economist and software developer, currently honing
            my skills through a blend of academic and practical experiences. I
            hold a Bachelor degree in Economic Sciences and Management from
            Universit√© Ibn Zohr, a program that has provided me with a robust
            understanding of economic theories and their real-world
            applications. Complementing my economics background, I have also
            specialized in IT development, earning a diploma as a Specialized
            Technician in Software Development from ITIAM.
